# MovieTracker CLI Application 

Welcome to my very first project! let me to introduce you to a MovieTracker application,
 this CLI application consists in searching at any movie you can imagine and it will print details like the Plot, Director, Actors and more...

## Installation

My GEMFILE is the following...
```ruby
gem 'movie_tracker'
gem "rake", "~> 12.0.0"
gem "rspec", "~> 3.0"


gem "httparty", "~> 0.18.0"

gem "json", "~> 2.3"

gem "pry", "~> 0.13.1"
```

## The Execution 

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install movie_tracker

## Usage

Please type bin/movie_tracker in your terminal and follow the instructions:

"please enter a movie title to search or type exit"

#please type any movie you want to watch 

after you get the results, type the number of the option you would like to see more information about

#results 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
